        Slashes (fractional addresses): 33 1/2 AVE
        Hyphens (hyphenated addresses): 289-01 MID-ISLAND PLZ (preferred MID ISLAND PLZ)

            significant and not removed. However, hyphens in the
            street or city name normally are not significant and
            may be replaced with a space.
